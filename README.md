#Portfolio Manager Leveraging Politician & Insider Trading Disclosures

##Task
Create a Python notebook to simulate a hedge fund portfolio manager using politician and insider trading data from Quiver Quantitative. The notebook should include sections for data collection (or mock data generation), alpha factor construction, backtesting, portfolio optimization, and optionally reinforcement learning. The code should be clean, well-commented, and modular, using libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, PyPortfolioOpt/cvxpy, and stable-baselines3. Start by setting up data access and building an initial alpha factor based on insider conviction or politician trades.
